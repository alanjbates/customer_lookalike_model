If we have a large list of prospects, which ones should we contact with limited marketing resources?

How can we predict which prospect looks most like our best existing customers?

This is an example notebook that shows how we can use Data Science principles to make better business decisions. Using the power of statistical models and prediction, we can start from what we feel is the best segment through data analysis and iterate through the data science lifecycle to get closer and closer to the best solution.

The XGBClassifier uses gradient boosting which is an ensemble model of decision trees.  This model is known for high performance and high accuracy.
